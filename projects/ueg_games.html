			<h2>UEG Online Games</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">design - development</h4>
			<p>The series of UEG's online games included poker, bingo, pulltabs, and slots. I was brought on to do a redesign of all the games and then re-code the games in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript to create a web and mobile application. We choose to go this route so that we could have one single code base that could be updated with having to update the app through Apple and Android everytime. In the redesign I was trying to give the games a little bit more of a modern feel then its very aged design it had currently.</p>
