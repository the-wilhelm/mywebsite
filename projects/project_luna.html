			<h2>Project Luna</h2>

			<p>Project Luna was the code name for the rebranding of OmahaNightlife.com. It was used to get the message out there that something big was coming to Omaha. We shut down OmahaNightlife.com, set up a timer on the website, handed out flyers, gave interviews in the newspaper, and created a small commercial for the release at the VFC fights.</p>
